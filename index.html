                    <p>
                        Hello! My name is Niha Thuppanna, a first year computer science student at Georgia Tech 
                        who enjoys building things that are both technically interesting and socially 
                        meaningful. I've worked on web and mobile projects while staying deeply 
                        involved in nonprofit work centered on academic assistance, tutoring, and 
                        mentorship, which has shaped how I think about using technology to support 
                        communities.
                    </p>
